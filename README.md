## Key Implementations
- **Android Development**: Developed Android applications using **Java/Kotlin**, implemented database management with **SQLite & Room**, and integrated cloud features with **Firebase**.  
- **iOS Development**: Built iOS apps using **Swift**, designed UI with SwiftUI & UIKit, and managed local storage with Core Data.  
- **Cross-Platform Apps**: Developed mobile applications using **Flutter** to ensure compatibility across Android & iOS.  
- **Cloud Integration**: Implemented **Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Push Notifications**.  
- **Real-time Networking**: Used **MQTT & WebSockets** for IoT and real-time data streaming in mobile apps.  
- **Security & Privacy**: Implemented **end-to-end encryption (E2EE), OAuth, and biometric authentication** for secure mobile applications.  

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- **For Android Development**:
  - Install **Android Studio** and set up an emulator.
  - Required dependencies:
    ```bash
    implementation 'androidx.room:room-runtime:2.3.0'
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-auth:21.0.1'
    ```
- **For iOS Development**:
  - Install **Xcode** and set up a simulator.
- **For Flutter**:
  - Install Flutter SDK and run:
    ```bash
    flutter doctor
    flutter run
    ```

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AjayKannan97/mobile-computing.git
   cd mobile-computing
   ```
2. Open the respective project in **Android Studio, Xcode, or VS Code**.
3. Run the mobile application on an **emulator or real device**.

## Results & Observations
- **Optimized Performance**: Used lightweight architectures like **MVVM** to improve efficiency.  
- **Scalable Cloud Services**: Firebase integration enabled real-time database updates and authentication.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Flutter ensured seamless performance across Android & iOS.  
- **Enhanced Security**: Implemented **AES encryption, OAuth, and biometric authentication**.
